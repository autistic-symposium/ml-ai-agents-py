#### order book

<br>

* the order book is made of two sides, asks (sell, offers) and bids (buy).
* the best ask (the lowest price someone is willing to sell ) > the best bid (the highest price someone is willing to
buy).
* the difference between the best ask and the best bid is called spread.
* **market order**: best price possible, right now. it takes liquidity from the market and usually has higher fees.
* **limit order (passive order)**: specify the price and qty you are willing to buy or sell at, and then wait for the
match.
* **stop orders**: allow you to set a maximum price for your market orders.
